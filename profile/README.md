## STYLE GUIDE
### **Actionables**
— **An hour or day of design is worth weeks or months in production**  
— **The assertion density of a codebase must average a minimum of 2 assertions per function**  
— **Use strict types, especially with sizes, at all times!**  
— **Assert and test… A LOT!!! This is true safety**  
— **Use the compiler’s strictest settings**  
— **All errors must be handled**  
- **Everything except constants use snake case. Constants use camel**  
— **Top-Level Doc describes the goal of the codebase or test. ESSENTIAL**  
— **Put the `main` function at the top. Order the rest alphabetically if you’re confused on order**  


**UNIX PHILOSOPHY**
1. Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new "features".
2. Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don't insist on interactive input.
3. Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks. Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.
4. Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task, even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you've finished using them.
